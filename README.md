# athletic_sales_analysis - Module 5 Challenge
The aim of this challenge is to analyze sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over a two year period. Then we focus on top selling retailers, and then look at dates of sales to identify top selling days and top selling weeks.
